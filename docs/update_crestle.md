# Welcome to Crestle.ai!
![](./images/crestle/landing_page.png)

[Crestle.ai](https://www.crestle.ai/) is an effortless infrastructure for deep learning. Once you sign up you should be able to spin up a GPU enabled Jupyter notebook within few minutes. There is no setup required on your part.

## Using crestle.ai for fast.ai v3 course

crestle.ai comes bundled with fast.ai course setup, including all the datasets (~35 GB) required as part of the course. You can just dive right into the relevant notebook and start training!

## Pricing

**We are offering the platform for free until 10/29/2018. After which the pricing below is in effect.**

Crestle uses Google Cloud Platform's n1-highmem-8 instances to provision a GPU instance. Using spot instance allows us to keep the costs low. We are hosted on multiple GCP regions thus providing a better guarantee on availability of instances.
Every GPU-enabled notebook is backed by a dedicated [NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-k80/).

Our goal is to keep the costs as low as possible for students and fast.ai practitioners. At the time of this writing we are charging:

- K80 GPU instance: $0.30 per hour, billed per second
- Storage: $0 (upto 75 GB) until 12/31/2018, after which it will be $0.10/GB/month.

You also get 1 hour of free GPU usage when you sign up.

## Getting started

### Step 1: Create a crestle.ai account
Sign up for Crestle [here](https://www.crestle.ai/). Verify your email by clicking on the link Crestle emails you. Once you have verified, you can sing in to your account.

### Step 2: Start your Jupyter notebook
Once you login you can start your Jupyter notebook with a press of a button. You will not be billed until you start your Jupyter notebook.

### Step 3: Navigate to fast.ai course
Once you start the notebook your GPU instance should be ready within a minute. We have already setup fast.ai for you. The directory structure available for you out of the box is as below:

```
- courses
     - fast-ai
        - course-v3
```

### Step 4: The datasets are already there - start coding!

We have already mounted the [datasets](http://course.fast.ai/datasets) required for this course. You don't have to download them. This is about 35 GB worth of data ready for you to train your models on.

You can navigate into the relevant notebook and start building.

### Step 5: Stop the instance when you are done

You need to **stop the instance** when you are done. This ensures you are not charged for time you are not spending training or coding. The stop button is located the top. You will be able to start your Jupyter instance as described in Step 2 any time.

Shutting down your instance will backup and snapshot the data from your home directory and will be avaible for you the next time you launch the instance.

**It's not enough to just close your browser or turn off your own computer.**

## What is installed?

crestle.ai has provisioned a [full Anaconda 5.3.0 Python environment](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/) which bundles many popular scientific packages.

Additonally we have also setup the fast.ai environment as described [here](https://github.com/fastai/fastai#conda-install) which includes Pytorch with GPU support and fastai library as well.

You can open the Terminal from Jupyter notebook and install additional libraries using `conda install` or even `pip install` which will install this on your home directory and will be backed up for you when you shutdown your instance.

### Update the course repo

To update the course repo, you will need to be in terminal. If you used the `ssh` method, you're already there, if you clicked on the 'Jupyter Notebook' button, launch a new terminal from the jupyter notebook menu.

```bash
cd fastai-courses/course-v3
git pull
```

<img alt="" src="/images/gradient/update.png" class="screenshot">

This should give you the latest of the course notebooks. If you modified some of the notebooks in course-v3/nbs directly, GitHub will probably throw you an error. You should type `git stash` to remove your local changes. Remember you should always work on a copy of the lesson notebooks.

### Update the fastai library

To update the fastai library, open the terminal like before and type

```bash
conda update conda
conda install -c fastai fastai
```

## Storage and Data

With crestle.ai we provide up to 75GB worth of storage for you. Please note that about 37GB of this is already taken for loading the datasets, anaconda and its dependencies.

You have complete read/write access to all this. Your home directory /home/nbuser contains the courses directory and anaconda install directory (hidden directory).

Anything you add to your home directory will be backed up for you for free.


## FAQs

### How is this different from crestle.com?

crestle.ai is a new version of crestle.com which was previously setup for fast.ai course. With crestle.ai we have optimized the setup to run the latest fast.ai v3 course. We have also made it much faster by moving away from EFS setup and have significantly reduced the price!
