# Welcome to Onepanel


This guide takes about 1 minute to complete. Once complete, you will have access to a CPU-enabled Jupyter Notebook that can be upgraded to a GPU-enabled notebook.

If you are returning to work and have previously completed the steps below, please go to the [returning to work](https://course.fast.ai/update_onepanel.html) section.

## Pricing

We recommend the `Nvidia K80 GPU` configuration which costs **$0.29** per hour.  We also offer Nvidia T4 and V100.  Hereâ€™s our full [pricing page](https://www.onepanel.io/fastai-pricing).

### Storage
You should use the suggested 80GB disk size, which is an additional **$0.0139 per hour**. You can increase the disk size later if you need more space.

### How much will you use this course
Considering that the course requires, over 2 months, 80 hours of homework plus the 2 hours of working through each lesson, we calculated roughly how much you would spend in the course.

- **Nvidia K80 GPU** + **Storage**: (80+2\*7)\*$0.29 + (80+2\*7)\*$0.0139\*2 = **$29.88**


## Step 1: Login with Github and add a Credit Card

## Step 2:  Upgrade CPU to a GPU

Click the tab near the top of the browser and a dialog box should pop up:

Once you select the GPU you want to use you can select the Spot option which is the lowest cost but occasionally the GPU will pause when demand is really high.  Your data will persist - so no worries.

Click 'RESTART' and your Notebook will reboot in under 5 mins.


## Step 3: Pausing your Notebook

Click the tab near the top of the browser and a dialog box should pop up:
