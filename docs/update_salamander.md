To return to your notebook, the basic steps will be:

1.  Start your instance
1.  Update the course repo
1.  Update the fastai library
1.  When done, shut down your instance

## Step by step guide

### Start your instance

Sign in to [salamander](https://salamander.ai/) and choose the instance you want to start, then click on the button 'Start Server'.

Wait about a minute for the server to start. You'll see the status go through several stages (written in orange) until it's ready like this:

You can then either ssh to your terminal by copying the content of the second box or click on the 'Jupyter Notebook' button to directly head to your notebooks

### Update the course repo

To update the course repo, you will need to be in terminal. If you used the `ssh` method, you're already there, if you clicked on the 'Jupyter Notebook' button, launch a new terminal from the jupyter notebook menu.

This will open a new window, in which you should run those two instructions:

```bash
cd course-v3
git pull
```

This should give you the latest of the course notebooks. If you modified some of the notebooks in course-v3/nbs directly, GitHub will probably throw you an error. You should type `git stash` to remove your local changes. Remember you should always work on a copy of the lesson notebooks.

### Update the fastai library

To update the fastai library, open the terminal like before and type

```bash
conda install -c fastai -c pytorch fastai pytorch
cd course-v3/
git pull
```

### Stop your instance

Once you're finished, go back to the [salamander page](https://salamander.ai/) and click on the 'Stop Server' button next to your instance.

**It's not enough to just close your browser or turn off your own computer.**
