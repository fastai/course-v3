To return to your notebook, the basic steps will be:

1. Start your instance
1. When done, shut down your instance

Your instance will run a script when started to update the fastai library and get the latest notebooks from the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3).

## Step by step guide

### Start your instance

Log in to the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) then click on the Sagemaker link (it should be in your history, otherwise find it in the 'Services' on the left or type sagemaker in the search bar). Once on this page, select 'Notebook instances' on the left menu.

Tick the box of the notebook you want to start, then click on 'Start'.

You will have to wait a little bit for your instance to be ready while the light under instance state is orange.

When it turns green, just click on 'Open' and you'll be back to your notebooks.

### Running custom code on notebook instance start
The SageMaker notebook will contain a custom script that will be run each time the notebook instance is started. The script can be found at the path `/home/ec2-user/SageMaker/custom-start-script.sh`.

The default behaviour is to update the fastai courses GitHub repository.

### Stop your instance
When you finish working you must go back to your [AWS console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker) and stop your instance manually to avoid getting extra charges. Just pick the notebook you want to stop and click on the 'Stop' button next to its name.

 **NOTE: you *will* be charged for the time that your instance is running.**
