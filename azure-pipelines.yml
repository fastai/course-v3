# Python package
# Create and test a Python package on multiple Python versions.
# Add steps that analyze code, save the dist with the build record, publish to a PyPI-compatible index, and more:
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/python?view=vsts

# Capabilities and limitations:
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=vsts&tabs=yaml#capabilities-and-limitations
# - Provide at least 10 GB of storage for your source and build outputs.
# - Can run jobs for up to 360 minutes (6 hours).

# Notes on pipeline definitions:
#
# the number after @ in task definition indicates the azure internal version of the specific task, e.g:
# - task: CondaEnvironment@1
# means use azure's CondaEnvironment's version 1, so need to check the docs for each specific task's desired (usually latest) version. If later 1.2 is released then use:
# - task: CondaEnvironment@1.2
# instead
#
# job name must match r'\w+' (no '-', but '_' ok)
#
# Build environments: Available vmImage values: 'Ubuntu-16.04', 'macOS-10.13', 'VS2017-Win2016'
#
