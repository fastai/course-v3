       "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

       "  xxmaj next to the original subject , i was also pleased by the actors ' performances and the humor . xxmaj there is no overacting , as you might expect in this kind of movies , it 's all very sober and realistic ( i guess that 's typical for the xxmaj scandinavians and xxmaj scandinavian movies ) . xxmaj the same for the humor . i 'm sure i would n't have liked it as much as i did now if the humor had been over the top , or with a lot of farting , vomiting , ... like you see so often in xxmaj american movies . i loved this movie and i give it an 8 / 10 .,xxbos i saw this on television more years ago than i can remember , but never forgot the performance of xxmaj sammy xxmaj davis , xxmaj jr. i just by chance thought to look for it on video . xxmaj this rendition of xxmaj porgy and xxmaj bess is a treasure . i would love to see it again and introduce my son to it as well . i just ca n't imagine why it is not heralded as one of the greatest performances xxmaj sammy xxmaj davis , xxmaj jr. every gave . xxmaj whoever is responsible for not bringing this to audiences should be ashamed of his / her ignorance . i will continue to look for it though . xxmaj maybe the execs responsible for such things will come to realize the forgotten work of so many xxmaj african xxmaj american actors .,xxbos xxmaj this movie is a sleeper - i 've watched every miniseries that was ever on xxup tv , some many times , and this one is the best . xxmaj wonderfully cast , superbly acted , and the characters are well - developed . xxmaj helen xxmaj morse perfectly fits the part of xxmaj jean xxmaj paget - strident , in control , sharp , and a bit belligerent . xxmaj she bounces well off of xxmaj joe xxmaj harmon , the cowboy / taciturn / \" xxmaj it 'll be okay \" sort of guy . i was sorry that the movie did n't stick to the book , in that there was no romantic interest between xxmaj noel xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj jean xxmaj paget . xxmaj for those who do n't know , this is taken from a true story about xxmaj english women marched around xxmaj xxunk for 3 years by the xxmaj japanese , who indeed did not know what to do with them . xxmaj very few of them survived . xxmaj neville xxmaj shute talked to one of them , and this is her story . xxmaj this movie deserves to be in everyone 's collection who loves xxup wwii stories .,xxbos xxmaj dragon xxmaj ma ( xxmaj jackie xxmaj xxunk back , having rid the seas of the dreaded xxmaj pirate xxmaj lo . xxmaj back on land , he is assigned to the police force , where he is to clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb . xxmaj along the way , he is caught up in the fate of several xxmaj chinese patriots attempting to secure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause . xxmaj the xxmaj chinese xxmaj manchu government is after these revolutionaries , and anyone that stands in their way is in trouble , even if they are in the police force . i had big expectations for this movie after i saw xxmaj project xxup a. xxmaj but sadly i was a little disappointed . xxmaj there is just too little action compared to the first film . xxmaj there is just one good fight scene until the big ending . xxmaj that fight scene is in the \" gangsters place \" and its good , a lot of people flying all over the place and hard kicks and punches are throw . xxmaj jackie xxmaj chan and his stunt team do n't disappoint here at all . xxmaj the ending is very entertaining , xxmaj jackie xxmaj chan shows us why xxup he is the best stuntman in the world . xxmaj really exciting stuff ! xxmaj the only bad thing with the ending , is that the fights are too short and forgettable . xxmaj conclusion : xxmaj many funny moments , good acting and crazy stunts . xxmaj but not enough fighting for a top rating .,xxbos xxmaj octavio xxmaj paz , xxmaj mexican poet , writer , and diplomat , who received the xxmaj nobel xxmaj prize for xxmaj literature in 1990 , said about \" xxmaj nazarin \" : \" xxmaj nazarin follows the great tradition of mad xxmaj spaniards originated by xxmaj cervantes . xxmaj his madness consists in taking seriously great ideas and trying to live accordingly \" . a humble and spiritual priest ( xxmaj francisco xxmaj rabal in a wonderful performance ) attempts to live by the principles of xxmaj christianity but is cast out of his church for helping a local prostitute by giving her a shelter after she had committed a murder . xxmaj nazarin wanders the country roads of the turn of the 20th - century xxmaj mexico , offering help to poor and begging for food . xxmaj his two followers , a murderous prostitute xxmaj andara and her sister xxmaj beatriz who is a failed suicide desperately searching for love , consider him saint but it does not prevent him from hatred and humiliation from both the church and the people he meets on the road . xxmaj he ends up beaten in prison and begins to question his faith for not be able to forgive his attacker . \n",

       "  i had never even heard of this film and had absolutely no expectations one way or the other . xxmaj considering that the other two dvds i picked up were big disappointments , i was so happy when i saw this film . xxmaj the acting , writing and direction were excellent . xxmaj the story itself definitely interested me , as you do n't usually see films about the final month of xxmaj france before the xxmaj nazi takeover in 1940 . xxmaj it gave some insight into the parasites that gave up so quickly and agreed to xxunk their beloved country . xxmaj along the way , there are plots involving a selfish and weak actress played very well by xxmaj isabelle xxmaj adjani -- who looks marvelous after all these years . xxmaj she kills an ex - lover and then finds a poor sap to take the fall . xxmaj this sap escapes from prison and finds her -- with another lover -- a high government official and weasel played by xxmaj gerard xxmaj depardieu . xxmaj in addition , a subplot about a xxmaj jewish physicist trying to smuggle xxunk out of the country is introduced and eventually this becomes the main plot . xxmaj the story has a lot of nice twists and turns , a light sense of humor ( without trying to be a comedy ) and some genuine suspenseful moments . xxmaj together , they create a nice package this is sure to please .,xxbos xxmaj henry : xxmaj portrait of a xxmaj serial xxmaj killer , part two ( 1998 ) was an ill advised and unwelcome sequel to the dark and brutal film xxmaj henry : xxmaj portrait of a xxmaj serial xxmaj killer ( 1986 ) . xxmaj many things are missing from this film that made the first one so memorable such as the original director and xxmaj michael xxmaj rooker . xxmaj without those you just have an average run - of - the - mill low budget slasher movie . xxmaj the movie lacks motivation and a theme . xxmaj the film makers turns xxmaj henry into just another movie monster who kills his victims creatively at every turn . \n",

       "  i guess that the subject cannibalism may not be enjoyed by everyone , especially not because it is shown with a lot of humor . xxmaj personally i liked it a lot . xxmaj it shows perfectly how far some people would go for some social acceptance and to get out of their isolation . xxmaj it may sound a bit far - fetched , but i 'm sure you would be surprised to see how people in real life sometimes act . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj next to the original subject , i was also pleased by the actors ' performances and the humor . xxmaj there is no overacting , as you might expect in this kind of movies , it 's all very sober and realistic ( i guess that 's typical for the xxmaj scandinavians and xxmaj scandinavian movies ) . xxmaj the same for the humor . i 'm sure i would n't have liked it as much as i did now if the humor had been over the top , or with a lot of farting , vomiting , ... like you see so often in xxmaj american movies . i loved this movie and i give it an 8 / 10 .,xxbos i saw this on television more years ago than i can remember , but never forgot the performance of xxmaj sammy xxmaj davis , xxmaj jr. i just by chance thought to look for it on video . xxmaj this rendition of xxmaj porgy and xxmaj bess is a treasure . i would love to see it again and introduce my son to it as well . i just ca n't imagine why it is not heralded as one of the greatest performances xxmaj sammy xxmaj davis , xxmaj jr. every gave . xxmaj whoever is responsible for not bringing this to audiences should be ashamed of his / her ignorance . i will continue to look for it though . xxmaj maybe the execs responsible for such things will come to realize the forgotten work of so many xxmaj african xxmaj american actors .,xxbos xxmaj this movie is a sleeper - i 've watched every miniseries that was ever on xxup tv , some many times , and this one is the best . xxmaj wonderfully cast , superbly acted , and the characters are well - developed . xxmaj helen xxmaj morse perfectly fits the part of xxmaj jean xxmaj paget - strident , in control , sharp , and a bit belligerent . xxmaj she bounces well off of xxmaj joe xxmaj harmon , the cowboy / taciturn / \" xxmaj it 'll be okay \" sort of guy . i was sorry that the movie did n't stick to the book , in that there was no romantic interest between xxmaj noel xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj jean xxmaj paget . xxmaj for those who do n't know , this is taken from a true story about xxmaj english women marched around xxmaj xxunk for 3 years by the xxmaj japanese , who indeed did not know what to do with them . xxmaj very few of them survived . xxmaj neville xxmaj shute talked to one of them , and this is her story . xxmaj this movie deserves to be in everyone 's collection who loves xxup wwii stories .,xxbos xxmaj dragon xxmaj ma ( xxmaj jackie xxmaj xxunk back , having rid the seas of the dreaded xxmaj pirate xxmaj lo . xxmaj back on land , he is assigned to the police force , where he is to clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb . xxmaj along the way , he is caught up in the fate of several xxmaj chinese patriots attempting to secure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause . xxmaj the xxmaj chinese xxmaj manchu government is after these revolutionaries , and anyone that stands in their way is in trouble , even if they are in the police force . i had big expectations for this movie after i saw xxmaj project xxup a. xxmaj but sadly i was a little disappointed . xxmaj there is just too little action compared to the first film . xxmaj there is just one good fight scene until the big ending . xxmaj that fight scene is in the \" gangsters place \" and its good , a lot of people flying all over the place and hard kicks and punches are throw . xxmaj jackie xxmaj chan and his stunt team do n't disappoint here at all . xxmaj the ending is very entertaining , xxmaj jackie xxmaj chan shows us why xxup he is the best stuntman in the world . xxmaj really exciting stuff ! xxmaj the only bad thing with the ending , is that the fights are too short and forgettable . xxmaj conclusion : xxmaj many funny moments , good acting and crazy stunts . xxmaj but not enough fighting for a top rating .,xxbos xxmaj octavio xxmaj paz , xxmaj mexican poet , writer , and diplomat , who received the xxmaj nobel xxmaj prize for xxmaj literature in 1990 , said about \" xxmaj nazarin \" : \" xxmaj nazarin follows the great tradition of mad xxmaj spaniards originated by xxmaj cervantes . xxmaj his madness consists in taking seriously great ideas and trying to live accordingly \" . a humble and spiritual priest ( xxmaj francisco xxmaj rabal in a wonderful performance ) attempts to live by the principles of xxmaj christianity but is cast out of his church for helping a local prostitute by giving her a shelter after she had committed a murder . xxmaj nazarin wanders the country roads of the turn of the 20th - century xxmaj mexico , offering help to poor and begging for food . xxmaj his two followers , a murderous prostitute xxmaj andara and her sister xxmaj beatriz who is a failed suicide desperately searching for love , consider him saint but it does not prevent him from hatred and humiliation from both the church and the people he meets on the road . xxmaj he ends up beaten in prison and begins to question his faith for not be able to forgive his attacker . \n",

       "  xxmaj bunuel tells the story in a manner of a xxmaj christian parable masterfully and uniquely combining admiration and irony for the main character and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy . xxmaj the film is simple and profound as well as beautiful , ironic , and heartbreaking . \n",

       "  i consider xxmaj bunuel one of the best filmmakers ever . i 've seen twenty of his films and they all belong to the different periods of his life but they have in common his magic touch , the masterful combination of gritty realism and surrealism , his curiosity , his inquisitive mind , his sense of humor , and his dark and shining fantasies . xxmaj with great pleasure i am adding little seen and almost unknown but amazingly candid and touching surrealistic tragic - comedy \" xxmaj nazarin \" to the list of my favorite films .\n",

       "  i had never even heard of this film and had absolutely no expectations one way or the other . xxmaj considering that the other two dvds i picked up were big disappointments , i was so happy when i saw this film . xxmaj the acting , writing and direction were excellent . xxmaj the story itself definitely interested me , as you do n't usually see films about the final month of xxmaj france before the xxmaj nazi takeover in 1940 . xxmaj it gave some insight into the parasites that gave up so quickly and agreed to xxunk their beloved country . xxmaj along the way , there are plots involving a selfish and weak actress played very well by xxmaj isabelle xxmaj adjani -- who looks marvelous after all these years . xxmaj she kills an ex - lover and then finds a poor sap to take the fall . xxmaj this sap escapes from prison and finds her -- with another lover -- a high government official and weasel played by xxmaj gerard xxmaj depardieu . xxmaj in addition , a subplot about a xxmaj jewish physicist trying to smuggle xxunk out of the country is introduced and eventually this becomes the main plot . xxmaj the story has a lot of nice twists and turns , a light sense of humor ( without trying to be a comedy ) and some genuine suspenseful moments . xxmaj together , they create a nice package this is sure to please .,xxbos xxmaj henry : xxmaj portrait of a xxmaj serial xxmaj killer , part two ( 1998 ) was an ill advised and unwelcome sequel to the dark and brutal film xxmaj henry : xxmaj portrait of a xxmaj serial xxmaj killer ( 1986 ) . xxmaj many things are missing from this film that made the first one so memorable such as the original director and xxmaj michael xxmaj rooker . xxmaj without those you just have an average run - of - the - mill low budget slasher movie . xxmaj the movie lacks motivation and a theme . xxmaj the film makers turns xxmaj henry into just another movie monster who kills his victims creatively at every turn . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the film follows the further exploits of xxmaj henry . xxmaj he travels around the back woods of xxmaj america continuing his murderous spree . xxmaj unlike the first film , we never get a glimpse into his sick and twisted mind . xxmaj it 's better to just forget this movie and pretends that it never happened . xxmaj that 's how i feel about this movie . \n",

       "  xxmaj not recommended for fans and non - fans of the original . xxmaj others definitely need not apply .,xxbos xxmaj too add to the comments already made in this database i would like to point out that viewers seem to forget that the testimony in the film by xxmaj major xxmaj hap xxmaj arnold , xxmaj captain xxmaj eddie xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj major xxmaj karl xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj xxunk xxunk xxunk xxmaj colonel xxmaj mitchell 's facts . \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj next to the original subject , i was also pleased by the actors ' performances and the humor . xxmaj there is no overacting , as you might expect in this kind of movies , it 's all very sober and realistic ( i guess that 's typical for the xxmaj scandinavians and xxmaj scandinavian movies ) . xxmaj the same for the humor . i 'm sure i would n't have liked it as much as i did now if the humor had been over the top , or with a lot of farting , vomiting , ... like you see so often in xxmaj american movies . i loved this movie and i give it an 8 / 10 .,xxbos i saw this on television more years ago than i can remember , but never forgot the performance of xxmaj sammy xxmaj davis , xxmaj jr. i just by chance thought to look for it on video . xxmaj this rendition of xxmaj porgy and xxmaj bess is a treasure . i would love to see it again and introduce my son to it as well . i just ca n't imagine why it is not heralded as one of the greatest performances xxmaj sammy xxmaj davis , xxmaj jr. every gave . xxmaj whoever is responsible for not bringing this to audiences should be ashamed of his / her ignorance . i will continue to look for it though . xxmaj maybe the execs responsible for such things will come to realize the forgotten work of so many xxmaj african xxmaj american actors .,xxbos xxmaj this movie is a sleeper - i 've watched every miniseries that was ever on xxup tv , some many times , and this one is the best . xxmaj wonderfully cast , superbly acted , and the characters are well - developed . xxmaj helen xxmaj morse perfectly fits the part of xxmaj jean xxmaj paget - strident , in control , sharp , and a bit belligerent . xxmaj she bounces well off of xxmaj joe xxmaj harmon , the cowboy / taciturn / \" xxmaj it 'll be okay \" sort of guy . i was sorry that the movie did n't stick to the book , in that there was no romantic interest between xxmaj noel xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj jean xxmaj paget . xxmaj for those who do n't know , this is taken from a true story about xxmaj english women marched around xxmaj xxunk for 3 years by the xxmaj japanese , who indeed did not know what to do with them . xxmaj very few of them survived . xxmaj neville xxmaj shute talked to one of them , and this is her story . xxmaj this movie deserves to be in everyone 's collection who loves xxup wwii stories .,xxbos * xxup this xxup comment xxup will xxup probably xxup have xxup spoilers ! ! i xxup checked xxup the xxup spoilers xxup box xxup just xxup in xxup case xxup but xxup it xxup might xxup not xxup have xxup spoilers , xxup but xxup be xxup aware xxup anyways xxup if i xxup say xxup something xxup that xxup you xxup might xxup consider a xxup spoiler xxup and i xxup don't ! * xxmaj wow ... best game since xxmaj super xxmaj mario 64 . i got this game the first day it came out , and before i got it , i went on some gaming websites to look at its ratings ( yes , they already reviewed it before it came out ) , and i was shocked . i was expecting something like xxmaj sunshine because lately all the xxmaj mario games have kind of been getting worse and worse . xxmaj but this one totally beat the other games . xxmaj the scores on this game even beat xxmaj halo 3 ! xxmaj it 's simply amazing . \n",

       "  xxup gameplay : xxmaj very entertaining , keeps you wanting to play more and more , and for me , since usually i tend to be very frustrated with games if i die a lot , i mean , i 'm definitely not the only one , but this game for me did n't have that a lot . xxmaj now it still kind of did , but not to the point like xxmaj mario 64 where i totally go crazy and end up turning off the game because it made me mad , this one never did that . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup difficulty : xxmaj there are two types of difficulty , because you can just technically beat the game with just 60 stars , which i think is kind of easy , but to beat the game 100 % , you have to get 120 , like always , and that quest is way harder , but at the same time still very fun . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup length : xxmaj good length , definitely not too short . xxmaj it took me around 15 - 16 hours to beat it with just 60 stars , but 120 took me more like 45 - 50 hours . xxmaj now i did n't play it constantly that much , i played first a lot one day , then the next couple of days just a couple hours each day , then the next two days i played it all day . xxmaj to me though , i think the quest for 60 stars was a tiny bit short , so if you want a long game , i suggest getting all of them . \n",

       "  xxup presentation : xxmaj now , the cinematic scenes in this movie are superb . xxmaj the way they are , it just looks so much like something i would see in the theaters . xxmaj they are hands down the best cinematic scenes on any xxmaj mario game so far . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup overall : xxmaj this game is definitely a great game , and i advise you to not wait until xxmaj christmas , get it as soon as possible . xxmaj this game also is a good mixture of old and new , you 'll have some xxunk levels where you move just side to side , or up and down because they 'll change on gravity , but even the music has some old classics in it . xxmaj so this game seems to be like a masterpiece . xxmaj to me , it 's my favorite xxmaj mario game of all time , but others may disagree . xxmaj but it 's still a great game . i recommend every gamer who wants to have fun in a game to get this .,xxbos xxmaj dragon xxmaj ma ( xxmaj jackie xxmaj xxunk back , having rid the seas of the dreaded xxmaj pirate xxmaj lo . xxmaj back on land , he is assigned to the police force , where he is to clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb . xxmaj along the way , he is caught up in the fate of several xxmaj chinese patriots attempting to secure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause . xxmaj the xxmaj chinese xxmaj manchu government is after these revolutionaries , and anyone that stands in their way is in trouble , even if they are in the police force . i had big expectations for this movie after i saw xxmaj project xxup a. xxmaj but sadly i was a little disappointed . xxmaj there is just too little action compared to the first film . xxmaj there is just one good fight scene until the big ending . xxmaj that fight scene is in the \" gangsters place \" and its good , a lot of people flying all over the place and hard kicks and punches are throw . xxmaj jackie xxmaj chan and his stunt team do n't disappoint here at all . xxmaj the ending is very entertaining , xxmaj jackie xxmaj chan shows us why xxup he is the best stuntman in the world . xxmaj really exciting stuff ! xxmaj the only bad thing with the ending , is that the fights are too short and forgettable . xxmaj conclusion : xxmaj many funny moments , good acting and crazy stunts . xxmaj but not enough fighting for a top rating .\n",

       " \n",
       "  xxup difficulty : xxmaj there are two types of difficulty , because you can just technically beat the game with just 60 stars , which i think is kind of easy , but to beat the game 100 % , you have to get 120 , like always , and that quest is way harder , but at the same time still very fun . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup length : xxmaj good length , definitely not too short . xxmaj it took me around 15 - 16 hours to beat it with just 60 stars , but 120 took me more like 45 - 50 hours . xxmaj now i did n't play it constantly that much , i played first a lot one day , then the next couple of days just a couple hours each day , then the next two days i played it all day . xxmaj to me though , i think the quest for 60 stars was a tiny bit short , so if you want a long game , i suggest getting all of them . \n",

       "  xxup presentation : xxmaj now , the cinematic scenes in this movie are superb . xxmaj the way they are , it just looks so much like something i would see in the theaters . xxmaj they are hands down the best cinematic scenes on any xxmaj mario game so far . \n",

       "  xxup overall : xxmaj this game is definitely a great game , and i advise you to not wait until xxmaj christmas , get it as soon as possible . xxmaj this game also is a good mixture of old and new , you 'll have some xxunk levels where you move just side to side , or up and down because they 'll change on gravity , but even the music has some old classics in it . xxmaj so this game seems to be like a masterpiece . xxmaj to me , it 's my favorite xxmaj mario game of all time , but others may disagree . xxmaj but it 's still a great game . i recommend every gamer who wants to have fun in a game to get this .,xxbos xxmaj dragon xxmaj ma ( xxmaj jackie xxmaj xxunk back , having rid the seas of the dreaded xxmaj pirate xxmaj lo . xxmaj back on land , he is assigned to the police force , where he is to clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb . xxmaj along the way , he is caught up in the fate of several xxmaj chinese patriots attempting to secure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause . xxmaj the xxmaj chinese xxmaj manchu government is after these revolutionaries , and anyone that stands in their way is in trouble , even if they are in the police force . i had big expectations for this movie after i saw xxmaj project xxup a. xxmaj but sadly i was a little disappointed . xxmaj there is just too little action compared to the first film . xxmaj there is just one good fight scene until the big ending . xxmaj that fight scene is in the \" gangsters place \" and its good , a lot of people flying all over the place and hard kicks and punches are throw . xxmaj jackie xxmaj chan and his stunt team do n't disappoint here at all . xxmaj the ending is very entertaining , xxmaj jackie xxmaj chan shows us why xxup he is the best stuntman in the world . xxmaj really exciting stuff ! xxmaj the only bad thing with the ending , is that the fights are too short and forgettable . xxmaj conclusion : xxmaj many funny moments , good acting and crazy stunts . xxmaj but not enough fighting for a top rating .\n",

       " \n",
       "  xxup difficulty : xxmaj there are two types of difficulty , because you can just technically beat the game with just 60 stars , which i think is kind of easy , but to beat the game 100 % , you have to get 120 , like always , and that quest is way harder , but at the same time still very fun . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup length : xxmaj good length , definitely not too short . xxmaj it took me around 15 - 16 hours to beat it with just 60 stars , but 120 took me more like 45 - 50 hours . xxmaj now i did n't play it constantly that much , i played first a lot one day , then the next couple of days just a couple hours each day , then the next two days i played it all day . xxmaj to me though , i think the quest for 60 stars was a tiny bit short , so if you want a long game , i suggest getting all of them . \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxup overall : xxmaj this game is definitely a great game , and i advise you to not wait until xxmaj christmas , get it as soon as possible . xxmaj this game also is a good mixture of old and new , you 'll have some xxunk levels where you move just side to side , or up and down because they 'll change on gravity , but even the music has some old classics in it . xxmaj so this game seems to be like a masterpiece . xxmaj to me , it 's my favorite xxmaj mario game of all time , but others may disagree . xxmaj but it 's still a great game . i recommend every gamer who wants to have fun in a game to get this .,xxbos xxmaj dragon xxmaj ma ( xxmaj jackie xxmaj xxunk back , having rid the seas of the dreaded xxmaj pirate xxmaj lo . xxmaj back on land , he is assigned to the police force , where he is to clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb . xxmaj along the way , he is caught up in the fate of several xxmaj chinese patriots attempting to secure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause . xxmaj the xxmaj chinese xxmaj manchu government is after these revolutionaries , and anyone that stands in their way is in trouble , even if they are in the police force . i had big expectations for this movie after i saw xxmaj project xxup a. xxmaj but sadly i was a little disappointed . xxmaj there is just too little action compared to the first film . xxmaj there is just one good fight scene until the big ending . xxmaj that fight scene is in the \" gangsters place \" and its good , a lot of people flying all over the place and hard kicks and punches are throw . xxmaj jackie xxmaj chan and his stunt team do n't disappoint here at all . xxmaj the ending is very entertaining , xxmaj jackie xxmaj chan shows us why xxup he is the best stuntman in the world . xxmaj really exciting stuff ! xxmaj the only bad thing with the ending , is that the fights are too short and forgettable . xxmaj conclusion : xxmaj many funny moments , good acting and crazy stunts . xxmaj but not enough fighting for a top rating .\n",

       "  xxmaj next to the original subject , i was also pleased by the actors ' performances and the humor . xxmaj there is no overacting , as you might expect in this kind of movies , it 's all very sober and realistic ( i guess that 's typical for the xxmaj scandinavians and xxmaj scandinavian movies ) . xxmaj the same for the humor . i 'm sure i would n't have liked it as much as i did now if the humor had been over the top , or with a lot of farting , vomiting , ... like you see so often in xxmaj american movies . i loved this movie and i give it an 8 / 10 .,xxbos i saw this on television more years ago than i can remember , but never forgot the performance of xxmaj sammy xxmaj davis , xxmaj jr. i just by chance thought to look for it on video . xxmaj this rendition of xxmaj porgy and xxmaj bess is a treasure . i would love to see it again and introduce my son to it as well . i just ca n't imagine why it is not heralded as one of the greatest performances xxmaj sammy xxmaj davis , xxmaj jr. every gave . xxmaj whoever is responsible for not bringing this to audiences should be ashamed of his / her ignorance . i will continue to look for it though . xxmaj maybe the execs responsible for such things will come to realize the forgotten work of so many xxmaj african xxmaj american actors .,xxbos xxmaj this movie is a sleeper - i 've watched every miniseries that was ever on xxup tv , some many times , and this one is the best . xxmaj wonderfully cast , superbly acted , and the characters are well - developed . xxmaj helen xxmaj morse perfectly fits the part of xxmaj jean xxmaj paget - strident , in control , sharp , and a bit belligerent . xxmaj she bounces well off of xxmaj joe xxmaj harmon , the cowboy / taciturn / \" xxmaj it 'll be okay \" sort of guy . i was sorry that the movie did n't stick to the book , in that there was no romantic interest between xxmaj noel xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj jean xxmaj paget . xxmaj for those who do n't know , this is taken from a true story about xxmaj english women marched around xxmaj xxunk for 3 years by the xxmaj japanese , who indeed did not know what to do with them . xxmaj very few of them survived . xxmaj neville xxmaj shute talked to one of them , and this is her story . xxmaj this movie deserves to be in everyone 's collection who loves xxup wwii stories .,xxbos * xxup this xxup comment xxup will xxup probably xxup have xxup spoilers ! ! i xxup checked xxup the xxup spoilers xxup box xxup just xxup in xxup case xxup but xxup it xxup might xxup not xxup have xxup spoilers , xxup but xxup be xxup aware xxup anyways xxup if i xxup say xxup something xxup that xxup you xxup might xxup consider a xxup spoiler xxup and i xxup don't ! * xxmaj wow ... best game since xxmaj super xxmaj mario 64 . i got this game the first day it came out , and before i got it , i went on some gaming websites to look at its ratings ( yes , they already reviewed it before it came out ) , and i was shocked . i was expecting something like xxmaj sunshine because lately all the xxmaj mario games have kind of been getting worse and worse . xxmaj but this one totally beat the other games . xxmaj the scores on this game even beat xxmaj halo 3 ! xxmaj it 's simply amazing . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup story : xxmaj not the best , xxmaj mario games are never known for their plots , and this one is n't really much of a difference . xxmaj bowser once again kidnaps xxmaj peach but this time invades the xxmaj mushroom xxmaj kingdom on a festival celebrated once every century and gets a flying saucer and it shoots lasers on the ground and then they put anchors inside the ground and rip off the castle and its foundation into outer space . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup graphics : xxmaj absolutely gorgeous , the best graphics on xxmaj wii so far . xxmaj the water effects are really nice too , if you ever see the water , it looks so real because the effects they put in it . \n",

       "  xxup music : xxmaj simply amazing , the music in this game is orchestrated . xxmaj not all of it , but even the ones that are n't orchestrated still sound very nice . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup gameplay : xxmaj very entertaining , keeps you wanting to play more and more , and for me , since usually i tend to be very frustrated with games if i die a lot , i mean , i 'm definitely not the only one , but this game for me did n't have that a lot . xxmaj now it still kind of did , but not to the point like xxmaj mario 64 where i totally go crazy and end up turning off the game because it made me mad , this one never did that . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup difficulty : xxmaj there are two types of difficulty , because you can just technically beat the game with just 60 stars , which i think is kind of easy , but to beat the game 100 % , you have to get 120 , like always , and that quest is way harder , but at the same time still very fun . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup length : xxmaj good length , definitely not too short . xxmaj it took me around 15 - 16 hours to beat it with just 60 stars , but 120 took me more like 45 - 50 hours . xxmaj now i did n't play it constantly that much , i played first a lot one day , then the next couple of days just a couple hours each day , then the next two days i played it all day . xxmaj to me though , i think the quest for 60 stars was a tiny bit short , so if you want a long game , i suggest getting all of them . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup presentation : xxmaj now , the cinematic scenes in this movie are superb . xxmaj the way they are , it just looks so much like something i would see in the theaters . xxmaj they are hands down the best cinematic scenes on any xxmaj mario game so far . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup overall : xxmaj this game is definitely a great game , and i advise you to not wait until xxmaj christmas , get it as soon as possible . xxmaj this game also is a good mixture of old and new , you 'll have some xxunk levels where you move just side to side , or up and down because they 'll change on gravity , but even the music has some old classics in it . xxmaj so this game seems to be like a masterpiece . xxmaj to me , it 's my favorite xxmaj mario game of all time , but others may disagree . xxmaj but it 's still a great game . i recommend every gamer who wants to have fun in a game to get this .,xxbos xxmaj dragon xxmaj ma ( xxmaj jackie xxmaj xxunk back , having rid the seas of the dreaded xxmaj pirate xxmaj lo . xxmaj back on land , he is assigned to the police force , where he is to clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb . xxmaj along the way , he is caught up in the fate of several xxmaj chinese patriots attempting to secure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause . xxmaj the xxmaj chinese xxmaj manchu government is after these revolutionaries , and anyone that stands in their way is in trouble , even if they are in the police force . i had big expectations for this movie after i saw xxmaj project xxup a. xxmaj but sadly i was a little disappointed . xxmaj there is just too little action compared to the first film . xxmaj there is just one good fight scene until the big ending . xxmaj that fight scene is in the \" gangsters place \" and its good , a lot of people flying all over the place and hard kicks and punches are throw . xxmaj jackie xxmaj chan and his stunt team do n't disappoint here at all . xxmaj the ending is very entertaining , xxmaj jackie xxmaj chan shows us why xxup he is the best stuntman in the world . xxmaj really exciting stuff ! xxmaj the only bad thing with the ending , is that the fights are too short and forgettable . xxmaj conclusion : xxmaj many funny moments , good acting and crazy stunts . xxmaj but not enough fighting for a top rating .\n",

       "  xxup music : xxmaj simply amazing , the music in this game is orchestrated . xxmaj not all of it , but even the ones that are n't orchestrated still sound very nice . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup gameplay : xxmaj very entertaining , keeps you wanting to play more and more , and for me , since usually i tend to be very frustrated with games if i die a lot , i mean , i 'm definitely not the only one , but this game for me did n't have that a lot . xxmaj now it still kind of did , but not to the point like xxmaj mario 64 where i totally go crazy and end up turning off the game because it made me mad , this one never did that . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup difficulty : xxmaj there are two types of difficulty , because you can just technically beat the game with just 60 stars , which i think is kind of easy , but to beat the game 100 % , you have to get 120 , like always , and that quest is way harder , but at the same time still very fun . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup length : xxmaj good length , definitely not too short . xxmaj it took me around 15 - 16 hours to beat it with just 60 stars , but 120 took me more like 45 - 50 hours . xxmaj now i did n't play it constantly that much , i played first a lot one day , then the next couple of days just a couple hours each day , then the next two days i played it all day . xxmaj to me though , i think the quest for 60 stars was a tiny bit short , so if you want a long game , i suggest getting all of them . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup presentation : xxmaj now , the cinematic scenes in this movie are superb . xxmaj the way they are , it just looks so much like something i would see in the theaters . xxmaj they are hands down the best cinematic scenes on any xxmaj mario game so far . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxup overall : xxmaj this game is definitely a great game , and i advise you to not wait until xxmaj christmas , get it as soon as possible . xxmaj this game also is a good mixture of old and new , you 'll have some xxunk levels where you move just side to side , or up and down because they 'll change on gravity , but even the music has some old classics in it . xxmaj so this game seems to be like a masterpiece . xxmaj to me , it 's my favorite xxmaj mario game of all time , but others may disagree . xxmaj but it 's still a great game . i recommend every gamer who wants to have fun in a game to get this .,xxbos xxmaj dragon xxmaj ma ( xxmaj jackie xxmaj xxunk back , having rid the seas of the dreaded xxmaj pirate xxmaj lo . xxmaj back on land , he is assigned to the police force , where he is to clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb . xxmaj along the way , he is caught up in the fate of several xxmaj chinese patriots attempting to secure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause . xxmaj the xxmaj chinese xxmaj manchu government is after these revolutionaries , and anyone that stands in their way is in trouble , even if they are in the police force . i had big expectations for this movie after i saw xxmaj project xxup a. xxmaj but sadly i was a little disappointed . xxmaj there is just too little action compared to the first film . xxmaj there is just one good fight scene until the big ending . xxmaj that fight scene is in the \" gangsters place \" and its good , a lot of people flying all over the place and hard kicks and punches are throw . xxmaj jackie xxmaj chan and his stunt team do n't disappoint here at all . xxmaj the ending is very entertaining , xxmaj jackie xxmaj chan shows us why xxup he is the best stuntman in the world . xxmaj really exciting stuff ! xxmaj the only bad thing with the ending , is that the fights are too short and forgettable . xxmaj conclusion : xxmaj many funny moments , good acting and crazy stunts . xxmaj but not enough fighting for a top rating .\n",
